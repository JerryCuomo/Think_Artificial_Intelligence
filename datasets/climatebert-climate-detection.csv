Based on the lessons learned during storms such as Superstorm Sandy, Hurricane Matthew, and Hurricane Michael, we have taken steps to increase the resilience of our network in affected areas and other at-risk areas. Depending on the area and risk, these steps to enhance infrastructure resilience have included adding stilts to raise equipment that powers cell sites, moving site generators from basements to a higher level or platforms, and installing new fiber solutions underground rather than using aerial fiber. We also have ongoing efforts to improve backup facility power systems, including power capacity at facilities located in areas with greater storm and wildfire risk, by adding generators to at-risk sites where, historically, the site only had backup batteries. Federal, state, and local regulators may create requirements that change the type and timing of actions we take, which could result in higher operating costs than anticipated.",1

"THE ISSUE Investors, in our view, have been too slow to recognize and address the substantial systemic threat that deforestation poses to the climate, local communities, biodiversity and human rights. Many consumer goods companies purchase commodities, like palm oil and soy, through supply chains that originate in rainforests in places like Indonesia and Guatemala. Deforestation is a principal driver of climate change, responsible for roughly 15 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions. Extensive—and oftentimes illegal—deforestation can have devastating impacts on biodiversity and on local and indigenous communities that depend on forests for their livelihoods. Deforestation has also been linked to severe human rights violations and, in recent years, environmental campaigners and protesters have been arrested and killed in record numbers.",1

"Investing in our estate and people The energy we use to power our estate also has a significant impact on our carbon footprint and the expertise of our people is an asset in managing climate- change issues because we recognise that colleagues making environmentally conscious decisions plays a part in our risk mitigation efforts. We continually invest in our estate, updating and integrating new energy-efficient features and equipment across our sites. – Our environmental management system provides a framework to help us oversee our environmental responsibilities effectively and meet our targets. Our offices are accredited to ISO 14001:2015 – an international standard. – The recent purchase of our Bristol office, The Core, saw environmental considerations central to the design. LED lighting, new chillers, heating, ventilation and an air conditioning system have made the site more energy efficient. As a result, running costs for our estate in Bristol are now 55% lower than they were in 2016. – We procure a 100% renewable electricity tariff through our partners at Engie and have done since 2014. We are in the process of applying for membership to RE100, a global initiative dedicated to accelerating a global shift in clean energy, under which we will continue our objective of sourcing 100% renewable electricity. In addition, we are increasingly enabling and encouraging flexible working and reduced business travel, leading to further reductions in Scope 3 emissions under our direct control. – Approximately 200 of our people do have jobs that require a car, and a number of others have an optional car lease benefit as part of their compensation. In August 2020, we announced an improved car scheme policy to encourage our people to make better decisions for the environment, including more hybrid and pure electric vehicle options. For cars that are company funded, the Group will also cover the costs of the installation of a charge point where an electric vehicle is chosen. – We have invested in a network of Environmental Champions across all our office sites and a growing network across our repair centres, all of whom have received accredited sustainability training. Our Environmental Champions work to engage colleagues and promote local awareness campaigns, as well as working with the local property teams to deliver local initiatives designed to reduce our environmental footprint. These initiatives are particularly focused on energy efficiency and waste. In addition to the reductions in energy usage across our estate, we also recycled 98% of our total waste in 2019 along with 100% of office waste being diverted from landfill.",1

"SPIER MOB GRAZING PROJECT The project is located on the Spier farm near Stellenbosch and involves soil-carbon enrichment. The project’s pasture management is based on the high-density grazing methodology developed in the 1980s. The presence of many animals in a small space for a short period of time means enormous amounts of manure and urine are deposited on the land, leading to healthy, robust pasture growth achieved without the application of fertilizer. Cattle are moved between four and six times per day and laying hens, accommodated in 'egg-mobiles', are moved every day. In accordance with the supply agreement, 50% of the revenue transferred from the registry to the project must be allocated directly to farm employees.",1

This target has been confirmed by the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTI).",1
"Energy is the single largest cost item in the production and distribution of industrial gases. Most of Linde’s energy requirements are in the form of electricity, natural gas and diesel fuel for distribution. Linde attempts to minimize the financial impact of variability in these costs through the management of customer contracts and reducing demand through operational productivity and energy efficiency. Large customer contracts typically have escalation and pass-through clauses to recover energy and feedstock costs. Such attempts may not successfully mitigate cost variability, which could negatively impact Linde’s financial condition or results of operations. The supply of energy has not been a significant issue in the geographic areas where Linde conducts business. However, regional energy conditions are unpredictable and may pose future risk.",1

"To mitigate business partner risks, adidas has implemented various measures. For example, we generally include clauses in contractual agreements with partners that allow us to suspend or even terminate our partnership in case of improper or unethical conduct. In addition, we work with a broad portfolio of promotion partners to reduce the dependency on the success and popularity of a few individual partners. We utilize a broad distribution strategy which includes further expansion of our direct-to-consumer business to reduce the risk of overreliance on key customers. Specifically, no single customer accounted for more than 5% of the company’s sales in 2020. To reduce risk in the supply chain, we work with suppliers who demonstrate reliability, quality and innovation. Furthermore, in order to minimize any potential negative consequences such as a violation of our Workplace Standards by our suppliers, we enforce strict control and inspection procedures at our suppliers and also demand adherence to social and environmental standards throughout our supply chain. In addition, we have selectively bought insurance coverage for the risk of business interruptions caused by physical damage to suppliers’ premises. To reduce supplier dependency, the company follows a strategy of diversification. In this context, adidas works with a broad network of suppliers in different countries and, for the vast majority of its products, does not have a single-sourcing model.",1
"(1) The expected long term rate of return on the U.S. and international plan assets is estimated based on the plans' investment strategy and asset allocation, historical capital market performance and, to a lesser extent, historical plan performance. For the U.S. plans, the expected rate of return of 7.27% was derived based on the target asset allocation of 40%-60% equity securities (approximately 8.5% expected return), 30%-50% fixed income securities (approximately 5.3% expected return) and 5%-15% alternative investments (approximately 6.8% expected return). For the international plans, the expected rate of return was derived based on the weighted average target asset allocation of 15%-25% equity securities (approximately 6.1% expected return), 30%-50% fixed income securities (approximately 4.8% expected return), and 30%-50% alternative investments (approximately 5.2% expected return). For the U.S. plan assets, the actual annualized total return for the most recent 10- year period ended December 31, 2019 was approximately 9.2%. For the international plan assets, the actual annualized total return for the same period was approximately 7.0%. Changes to plan asset allocations and investment strategy over this time period limit the value of historical plan performance as factor in estimating the expected long term rate of return. For 2020, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets will be 7.00% for the U.S. plans. Expected weighted average returns for international plans will vary.",0
"Development of the Alberta oil sands has received considerable attention in recent public commentary on the subjects of environmental impact, climate change and GHG emissions.

In other words, the trend is evaluating the financial values of non-financial information. The relevant companies would need to follow this trend and disclose related information faithfully. As corporate citizens that follow the UN SDGs, companies must perceive their roles and promote the relevant matters with an active mindset. Governance should be improved as well. In particular, LG Chem must disclose information transparently and establish a clear stance. Since LG Chem is the best and leading chemical company in Korea, its stakeholders will ask for flawless corporate management. LG Chem should feel proud and responsible at the same time because the society has great expectations for the company to meet the highest level of ESG regarding the rights of shareholders, safety and health of workers, health and privacy of consumers, and fair trading.
