2,"What is your perspective on the current state and future impact of AI on society, particularly in terms of job transformation and addressing inequalities?","I say this is a new renaissance. At one point in time, not a lot of people were believers of AI. And since then, we've seen this boom that took us from winter to spring. So we're seeing a lot of transformation. A lot of jobs, unfortunately, would be rendered obsolete, but new industries are going to sprout in this spring, and that will take us to summer. New job creation, a lot of inequities would've been solved. There's people in inner cities, people in rural areas that never had awesome education, never had opportunities, and now, for the first time in human history, problems that humans created, AI will help solve.",1,Formal,"AI, Society","Technology, Artificial Intelligence","Yahoo Finance.

And how do we get folks from the inner cities or underserved communities, underdeveloped communities, poverty- stricken communities to learn how to code and train data and write algorithms so we have a balance?

But right now, it's good at mimicking. And with lack of regulations while it mimics copyrights, IP, all these things fall under question. And when there's no regulations and governance around things being deployed, that's where the real issue is.

Although while there's regulations on the safeties and traffic from people getting from point A to point B, every car manufacturer that deploys a car is vetted. There's safety procedures put in place, there's airbags or seatbelts. You know what you're buying. Every person that's going to operate that vehicle has to take a written test and a physical test, and that combination keeps streets safe. The same is not for these technologies that are being deployed. As a matter of fact, the folks that are making the technologies, there's no license. You don't have to be licensed to deploy AI, but you have to be licensed to deploy cars.

And so that means your IP, your copyrights, it's all up for grabs or at threat because every single product has different terms and conditions that no one ever reads.

9,"You've emphasized personal data ownership.

Right now, that's not the case with a lot of the tools that we use. So I'm audacious. Why am I building a messenger? Well, because there's no other messenger to make sure that your data is your data, and here's some elliptical- curve cryptography to keep it safe because what other option do you have? So the only way to do that is to use a technology that's available. There's a company called Builder. ai. If you don't know how to code, you could still make products. You don't have to wait around for like, ""I can't wait for a product to come my way.Ã“ You could do that yourself.

Michael Jackson, Stevie Wonder, Songs of the Key of Life is the best compilation of ideas, songs we've ever seen. But that didn't stop me from wanting to create. And so, the same is for AI.

12,Can you share more about the i.am/angel Foundation and whom it benefits?                ,"So the i.am/Angel Foundation, we've been at it for, wow, almost for a while, since 2008. I started with 65 students teaching them computer science and robotics as they pursued their path to college. And now, we serve just a little over 13, 000 students in LA. We're in over 300 schools with our partnership with LAUSD. We've sent kids to Dartmouth, to Brown, to Stanford, to USC, UCLA, and we're really proud of the kids' commitment, dedication, and now we want to just scale it. Because in 2008 when I had the hunch to get kids prepared for this technological tomorrow, damn were we right. Imagine if you said, Ã’Hey, Will, what does your foundation do?Ã“ And I said, Ã’Tanya, we go up and we put billboards in the inner city because the kids need to know, the people in the communities need to know what to buy even though they can't afford it.Ã“ Guess what? You don't have to do that because there's so many billboards in the inner city where people can't even afford to buy the things that they're promoting or selling on billboards. And if you go to the rich neighborhoods, the thing that you don't see are billboards. If you drive down Beverly Hills, you don't see billboards advertising food that's bad for the community. But for some reason in the inner city, you see billboards promoting and selling horrible products that are not good for their health. So should my foundation, the only reason why I'm doing education around STEM is because I'm filling a hole that government should be doing or filling a hole, yeah, government should be making sure that every single school has robotics and computer science. Isn't that what our tax dollars are for? Why should my freaking foundation be filling a void to educate people? That's pretty nuts.

13,What do you think it was growing up that made you then want to make a difference?,"So I come from a very poor neighborhood in East LA, Boyle Heights that's being gentrified as we speak. People that used to be able to afford to live there, inflation's going up, rent's going up, and the cool folks are moving in. We saw it happen in Brooklyn, but at the time when I was being raised there, I got bussed out to Palisades and I'm a recipient of someone's philanthropic concepts, the magnet program, free lunches, summer lunches, free milk, free cheese. So I was a recipient. If someone had an idea like, Ã’You know what? Let's make sure kids from the inner city get a good education.Ã“ And I got one. And so now that I've had success in music, I'm like, why do kids have to leave their neighborhood to get a good education? Why can't they stay in their community? Get up- skilled so that when they have these skill sets, they could change the conditions of their neighborhood themselves and gentrification happens from the inside and people get educated, they bring opportunities to their community because they have the skills to bring the jobs and the industries with the skillsets that they learn because it's going to happen anyhow. Folks that live in nice little comfy neighborhoods, they hear the songs that come from the inner city be like, Ã’You know what? I think I want to move to Brooklyn. There's a lot of rap songs about it.Ã“ Compton in the next 15 years is going to be like gentrified like, Ã’Yo, I remember listening to these songs about Compton.Ã“ They're promoting communities or Inglewood. Inglewood is like transformed, SoCal Stadium. That's like Snoop Dogg land. He was talking about freaking Long Beach way before the stadium went there, and it's being transformed. Why can't the transformation happen from inside? Like Dubai, that transformation happened from inside. That city, think about that country, and I remember going there in 2005, it wasn't what it is now. Places like Singapore and the UAE are not as old as my grandmother or my mom, and look at the boom.

There was fake news in 2020. This fake news is something else. There's fake conversations. You can be talking to somebody you think is somebody that's not somebody.
